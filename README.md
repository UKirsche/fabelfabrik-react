# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Initialize Gradle

If you need to build the Android app with Gradle, you can initialize Gradle for the project by running:

```bash
npm run init-gradle
```

This command will:
1. Generate the native Android project with Gradle configuration
2. Create the Android directory with all necessary Gradle files
3. Configure the project for building with Gradle

After initializing Gradle, you can:
- Run `cd android && ./gradlew tasks` to see available Gradle tasks
- Run `npm run build:android` to build the Android app using EAS
- Run `npm run android` to start the app in development mode

## Run Configurations
